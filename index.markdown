I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota, where I anticipate completing my degree in May 2025 under the supervision of [Ben Brubaker](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~brubaker/).
My parents chose a non-standard basis, so most people call me by my middle name Suki.  

My current research interests are predominantly in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics.
In particular, I am interested in using solvable lattice models and representations of quantum groups to study invariants of Schubert varieties and Richardson varieties that can be packaged in the form of recursively defined functions.

If we have overlapping interests, I would be happy to hear from you.
